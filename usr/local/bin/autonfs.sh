# AutoNFS v1.2.1

# (c) 2012/2013 by Martin Seener (martin@seener.de)
# Licensed under the GPLv2

# Code can be found at github.com/martinseener/autonfs
# Original Idea from JeroenHoek at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1389291

# Hints:
#   - only limited logging is active; for debug logging, uncomment all "logger" lines

# Changelog:
#   v1.0:
#     - initial version
#   v1.1:
#     - added NFSVERS parameter which prevents the server from writing
#       "unkown version" warnings into syslog for each call
#   v1.2 (2013-04-10):
#     - improved NFS Server check (double checks its N/A before unmounting)
#       - sometimes the first check is a false positive, therefore doing two
#     - improved debug syslogging (added tag and more useful information)
#     - added some more inline comments for explanation
#   v1.2.1 (2013-04-12)
#     - logging is only done when something is not working in first place (limited logging)

# The hostname or IP-address of the fileserver:
FILESERVER="nfsserver.example.com"
# The NFS Version to be checked (must given to prevent "unknown version" syslog warnings)
NFSVERS=3
# Mount Options (see mount man pages for info)
MOUNTOPT="-o rw,hard,intr,tcp,actimeo=3"
# Check every X seconds (60 is a good default):
INTERVAL=60
# The shares that need to be mounted:
MOUNTS=( "/mnt/share" )

# Write PID to a PIDFILE for later process kill
# The init script handles the kill process and if there`s already a process running
echo $$ > /var/run/autonfs.pid
