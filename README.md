# AutoNFS

AutoNFS is a client-side autofs-free NFS Share Automount-Script, initially designed for Debian Squeeze or derivates it now also runs smoothly on systems that use SysVinit, Upstart or Systemd init-systems like Ubuntu, OpenSUSE or RHEL/CentOS.

#### Status
- *Master-Branch*: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Barzahlen/autonfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Barzahlen/autonfs)
- *Development-Branch*: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Barzahlen/autonfs.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Barzahlen/autonfs)

## Available versions

If you want the latest stable version of AutoNFS you can easily stick with the master branch. If you want a specific version, checkout the respective branch.
The latest stuff is always available on the Development branch.

## Installation and Usage

The locations of the files are given through the folders in this Repository, so for example the autonfs.sh should reside in /usr/local/bin folder in your NFS-Client but starting v1.3 it can differ if new location is correctly set in /etc/default/autonfs config file.

1. Place a copy of the autonfs.sh (actual script) in the desired folder
2. Place a copy of the autonfs init/upstart/systemd file in the desired folder (see your init-systems folder)
  - Make both executable with `chmod +x /<path to the files>`
3. Place the /etc/default/autonfs file in the same path on your machine
  - Modify the file by setting the correct `NFSSERVER` and `MOUNTS` vars and optionally `NFSVERS`, `MOUNTOPT` and `INTERVAL` and set the correct location of the autonfs.sh script, if you have placed it differently from the default in step 1!
4. Install the init script for bootup with `update-rc.d autonfs defaults`
5. Start AutoNFS with `service autonfs start` ... the mounted folders will magically appear

AutoNFS will now completly take care of those mounts by checking the NFS Server regularily (`INTERVAL`) if its up or down. If its down, it will unmount the shares after 2 check-failures and will auto-remount them as soon as the server is back up. In that case it will also write it to the syslog.

You can also uncomment all lines starting with `#logger` to get a more verbose syslog output (not needed in production)

## Variables explanation

- `SCRIPTPATH` - The path to the AutoNFS executable (default: /usr/local/bin/autonfs.sh)
- `LOGLEVEL` - Set the desired log level from 0 (disabled) trough 1 (normal logging) to 2 (debug logging)
- `NFSSERVER` - The NFS Server you want to mount something from can be either a single IP or a DNS-Name
- `NFSVERS` - Defines the NFS Protocol (2,3 or 4) to be used for checking the Server and is needed to prevent writing "unknown version" warnings in the syslog
- `MOUNTOPT` - Here you can define the classic NFS Mount options like you would in the fstab (uses good defaults for most scenarios)
- `INTERVAL` - How often should AutoNFS check the Server? (60seconds is a good default but we use 15seconds for our HA Environment)
- `MOUNTS` - This is a space-separated list of shares to mount for ex. `MOUNTS=( "/share1" "/share2" )`, whereas the share name and mountpath must be the same in this version. In a later version i will also support different shares and mount-paths
